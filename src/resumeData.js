  "aboutme":"I was born in Venezuela but moved to the United States at the age of 13. Throughout my career I have vastly increased my knowledge in business, fashion, and technology. Growing up, I pursued the value of style and trends, while focusing on customer service; I have been able to expand my horizons in different areas of work. Web development has come to me as a plus. With the dynamics of the changing world regarding e-commerce, my love for tech has also evolved. During my education, I received my MBA in Web Development from Lynn University in just 5 years having also double majored in International Business and Fashion and Retail. While at Wyncode I received training in a variety of tech skills. I created dynamic and responsive web applications with my team using Agile methodologies. While at Bloomingdales, I had the privilege to be trained by my manager on how to manage our team because he knew how motivated I was to be a team leader. Iâ€™m working diligently to bring my love for coding, design, and fashion into the business world.",
